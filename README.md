Google_Routes
=============
Playing around with Google Maps JavaScript API V3.

This web-project calculates directions for different transportation types such as car, walk, bike and public transportation. It displays the route as well as the duration and distance for each transportation type using Google Maps Directions.

Furthermore, it uses Google Maps Places-Autocomplete function and Geocoder to find an address and display the coordinates.

For the design, Twitter-Bootstrap is used.
